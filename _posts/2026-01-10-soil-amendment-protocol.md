# Soil Amendment Protocol

## Baseline Testing
Annual soil test conducted October 2025:
- **pH:** 6.2 (target: 6.5-7.0)
- **N:** Low
- **P:** Adequate
- **K:** Low

## Amendment Plan
Based on test results:
1. **Lime:** 50 lbs per 1000 sq ft (raise pH)
2. **Compost:** 3" layer (nitrogen + organic matter)
3. **Greensand:** 10 lbs per 1000 sq ft (potassium)

## Application Schedule
- **Fall:** Lime and greensand (allows time to break down)
- **Spring:** Compost (top-dress before planting)

## Expected Results
Retest in spring 2026 to verify pH adjustment and nutrient levels.
