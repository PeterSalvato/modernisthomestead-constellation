# Winter Garden Planning

## Objective
Plan and prepare for winter vegetable production in Zone 7a (mid-Atlantic region).

## Crop Selection
Based on frost tolerance and grow time:
- **Kale:** 60 days to maturity, frost-hardy
- **Spinach:** 45 days, cold-tolerant
- **Garlic:** Plant in fall, harvest in summer
- **Carrots:** 70 days, sweetens after frost

## Bed Preparation
1. Clear summer crop residue
2. Add compost (2" layer)
3. Test soil pH (target: 6.5-7.0)
4. Rake smooth and water

## Timeline
- **October 15:** Garlic planting
- **November 1:** Kale and spinach starts
- **November 15:** Direct seed carrots

## Notes
Last frost date typically April 15. Plan spring succession planting accordingly.
