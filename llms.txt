# Modernist Homestead

> Zero-willpower household systems for a neurodivergent family.

## About

ADHD means working memory is a scarce resource. Autism means sensory regulation is architecture, not preference. Celiac means a contamination is a medical event. Willpower runs out by 5 PM. Improvisation stopped working.

Culinary modularity: five cuisine traditions organized by structural flavor elements (umami, acidity, heat, smoke). Sensory zoning: individual quiet rooms, pair study nooks, small-group kitchen, large-group living room. Executive function scaffolding: weekly check-ins, default meals, kitchen workflow design. Celiac protocol: separate surfaces, tools, cutting boards. Gamification: chore quests, XP, station-based rewards.

The system does the thinking when thinking is exactly what's constrained. The environment holds decisions so the people don't have to.
